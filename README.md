# Robotic Utility Barely Beneficial In Serving Humans
## Statistical text generator

This Program generates text based on patterns in an analyzed corpus.

## Usage
On first execution, RUBBISH will create a `./corpora` folder. There, you should create a new folder with a name of your corpus containing .txt files. When this folder is chosen, RUBBISH will create `./corpora/your_corpus_name_/data` folder, where it will place cached files. RUBBISH will then tokenize the corpus and analyze patterns in it. After this you can input text which will then be continued. 

## Example
(this example uses a corpus containing some project gutenberg books)

File structure before:
```
parent/
├─ corpora/
│  ├─ gutenberg/
│  │  ├─ An ethical philosophy of life presented in its main outlines - Felix Adler.txt
│  │  ├─ The Dance of Life - Havelock Ellis.txt
│  │  ├─ The Price of a Soul - William Jennings Bryan.txt
│  │  ├─ The Sixth Sense - Its Cultivation and Use - Charles Henry Brent.txt
```

## Limitations
RUBBISH is known to straight up copy fragments of the corpus. Lower phrase length and larger corpora make this less likely.
